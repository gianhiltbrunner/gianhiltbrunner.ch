This vegetarian tantanmen delivers the classic spicy, nutty flavors of the Sichuan-inspired ramen without meat. A light vegetable chintan provides the base, enriched with ground sesame tare and aromatic chili oil. The blended soup creates a creamy, unified broth that coats the noodles beautifully.

## Tantanmen Bowl

Makes 1 bowl

The key to tantanmen is blending the soup, tare, and oil together at high speed to create an emulsified, creamy broth. This unifies all the flavors and creates the characteristic texture.

- 350 milliliters vegetable chintan
- 65 grams tantanmen tare (one serving)
- 15 milliliters chili oil

1. Combine the chintan, tare, and chili oil in a blender.
2. Blend at high speed until fully emulsified and homogeneous.
3. Pour into a serving bowl.

**Assembly:**

- 130 grams ramen noodles, cooked
- 1 half-cooked egg
- Toppings such as enoki mushrooms, scallions, or pak choi

## Vegetable Chintan

- 3 liters water
- 1 onion, split and peeled
- 1 carrot, peeled and cut into large chunks
- 10 cloves garlic
- 1 5-centimeter piece of ginger
- 10 grams dried shiitake
- 1 bunch of green onions
- 20 grams kombu

This light vegetable stock forms the base of the soup. The shiitake and kombu provide umami depth, while the aromatics add complexity. Unlike heavier stocks, this chintan stays clear and delicate.

1. Add the water, onion, carrot, garlic, ginger, and shiitake to a pot.
2. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer.
3. Cook at a gentle simmer (around 95°C) for one hour.
4. Add the green onion and kombu, turn off the heat, and let steep for 15 minutes.
5. Strain the soup and reserve until needed.

## Tantanmen Tare

- 35 grams soy sauce
- 3 grams rice wine vinegar
- 25 grams ground sesame (either tahini or nerigoma)
- 2 grams MSG

This tare is all about sesame. Use nerigoma (Japanese sesame paste) for the most authentic flavor, though tahini works as a substitute. The paste provides richness and a nutty backbone that defines tantanmen.

Combine all ingredients in a bowl, whisking vigorously until fully incorporated and smooth. The mixture should be thick but pourable.

## Chili Oil

- 250 milliliters vegetable oil
- 8 cloves garlic
- 1 5-centimeter piece of ginger, sliced into 0.5-centimeter coins
- Half of a small onion
- 3 tablespoons coarsely ground togarashi
- 4 dried Chinese chilis
- 1-2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns

This aromatic chili oil adds both heat and the distinctive tingling sensation from Sichuan peppercorns. The slow infusion extracts maximum flavor without burning the spices. The oil keeps for months, so make a larger batch if desired.

1. In a small saucepan, add the oil, garlic, ginger, and onion.
2. Heat over medium to medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the ingredients take on a light golden hue and smell fragrant, around 15 minutes.
3. Add the togarashi, Chinese chilis, and Sichuan peppercorns.
4. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the ingredients steep in the oil for 30 minutes.
5. Strain and transfer to a container. If not using immediately, keep refrigerated for up to 6 months.

## Half-Cooked Eggs

- Refrigerated eggs

These ajitsuke tamago (seasoned eggs) feature a jammy yolk with a firm white, marinated in a savory-sweet soy mixture. The ice bath stops the cooking process instantly, ensuring the perfect texture every time.

1. Bring a large pot of water to a full boil.
2. In a large bowl or container, fill with ice and cold water to make an ice bath. Reserve.
3. Remove eggs from the refrigerator.
4. Working in batches of 4-6 eggs at a time to avoid the water temperature dropping too quickly, lower your eggs into the boiling water.
5. Boil the eggs, stirring occasionally during the first minute or so of cooking, for 6-7 minutes, depending on how firm you'd like the yolk. I prefer 7 minutes for a slightly custardy yolk. For a completely liquid yolk, cook for 6 to 6.5 minutes.
6. After the time is up, quickly remove the eggs from the water and place them in the ice bath from step 2. Hold for 15 minutes, or until thoroughly chilled.

### Marinade

- One part soy sauce
- One part mirin
- One part water

1. Place peeled eggs in an airtight container, such as a hard plastic container or a sealable bag.
2. Pour the above ingredients into the container to cover (you may not need to use all the brine; reduce the amount as necessary).
3. Soak, jostling contents every hour or so, for 4-6 hours.
4. Remove from brine and reserve in the fridge until needed.
