## Ramen Bowl

Makes 1 bowl

This yuzu shio ramen balances clean, light flavors with aromatic depth. The yuzu in the tare provides brightness without overwhelming the delicate chintan.

- 370 milliliters chintan broth, hot
- 30 milliliters yuzu shio tare
- 13 milliliters aromatic oil
- 130 grams ramen noodles, cooked
- Toppings: sliced scallions, nori, menma (bamboo shoots)

1. Add the tare and aromatic oil to the bottom of a serving bowl.
2. Pour the hot chintan over the tare and oil, whisking gently to combine.
3. Add the cooked noodles.
4. Top with scallions, nori, and menma.

## Chintan Broth

- 1 large (2-kilo) whole chicken (or 2 small whole chickens)
- Water (1 part chicken to 2 parts water by volume)
- 10 grams bonito flakes (katsuobushi)
- 5 grams kombu

This chintan is a clear, light chicken broth enhanced with a quick dashi infusion. The bonito and kombu are added after cooking to preserve their delicate flavors and prevent the broth from becoming cloudy.

1. Place the chicken in a large pot and cover with water using a 1:2 ratio by volume.
2. Bring to a boil over high heat. As scum rises to the surface, skim it off carefully.
3. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer (around 85-90°C).
4. Simmer for 2-3 hours, skimming occasionally, until the broth is flavorful and aromatic.
5. Remove from heat and strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth.
6. Place the bonito flakes and kombu in a tea bag or cheesecloth sachet.
7. Add the sachet to the hot strained broth and let steep for 10 minutes.
8. Remove the sachet and discard. The chintan is ready to use.

The bonito adds umami depth while the kombu contributes subtle oceanic notes. This two-stage process keeps the broth crystal clear while building complex flavor layers.

**The Chemistry of Umami Synergy**: Kombu contains glutamate (glutamic acid), while bonito provides inosinate (inosinic acid). When combined, these two umami compounds create a synergistic effect where the total umami intensity is approximately 8 times greater than the sum of each component alone. This multiplicative interaction occurs because glutamate and inosinate bind to different umami receptors on the tongue, amplifying the overall savory perception. This is why adding both kombu and bonito transforms a simple chicken broth into something extraordinary.

## Yuzu Shio Tare

- 40 milliliters mirin
- 2.5 grams sugar
- 19 grams salt
- 62 milliliters chintan broth
- 2.5 milliliters rice vinegar
- 7-10 milliliters yuzu juice (adjust to taste)
- 2 grams MSG

This shio tare is built around yuzu, the prized Japanese citrus with a distinctive floral-tart flavor. The mirin adds subtle sweetness that balances the salt and acidity.

1. In a small saucepan, combine the mirin and sugar.
2. Heat gently over medium-low heat until the sugar dissolves completely.
3. Add the salt and chintan broth, stirring to dissolve the salt.
4. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature.
5. Add the rice vinegar, yuzu juice, and MSG. Stir well to combine.
6. Taste and adjust yuzu juice as desired. Start with 7 ml for subtle citrus, up to 10 ml for brighter flavor.
7. Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

Use 30 milliliters of tare per bowl. Yuzu juice can vary in intensity, so adjust to your preference.

## Aromatic Oil

- 100 milliliters vegetable oil (neutral flavor, such as grapeseed or canola)
- 1 5-centimeter piece of fresh ginger, sliced into thin coins
- 4 cloves garlic, smashed
- 2-3 dried red chilis, whole or broken
- 2-3 green onions (scallions), white and light green parts only, cut into 3-centimeter pieces

This aromatic oil adds warmth and complexity to the bowl. The gentle infusion extracts flavor without burning the aromatics, creating a fragrant oil that complements the citrus notes.

1. In a small saucepan, combine the oil, ginger, garlic, and chilis.
2. Place over medium-low heat and warm gently. You should see small bubbles forming around the aromatics, but not aggressive frying.
3. Cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the ginger and garlic are golden and fragrant. Watch carefully to prevent burning.
4. Remove from heat and immediately add the green onions. The residual heat will gently cook them without burning.
5. Let the aromatics steep in the oil for 10 minutes.
6. Strain the oil through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean container, discarding the solids.
7. Store at room temperature for up to 1 week, or refrigerate for up to 1 month.

Use 13 milliliters of aromatic oil per bowl. The ginger provides a warming bite, while the garlic adds savory depth and the chilis contribute gentle heat.
