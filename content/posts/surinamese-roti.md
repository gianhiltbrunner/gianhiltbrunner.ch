This Surinamese roti is a beloved weeknight staple in the Netherlands, where my partner is from. It's a comforting curry of potatoes and green beans, spiced with aromatic roti masala, served with hard-boiled eggs and wrapped in warm flatbread. Simple, satisfying, and perfect for busy evenings.

## Roti Filling

- 800 grams potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-centimeter pieces
- 400 grams green beans, ends trimmed and halved
- 2 medium onions, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2-3 tablespoons roti spice (recipe below)
- 1 can (400 grams) diced tomatoes
- 500 milliliters water or vegetable stock
- Salt, to taste
- 4-6 hard-boiled eggs, peeled

**For serving:**
- 4-6 store-bought roti or paratha flatbreads

This curry is all about building layers of flavor with the aromatic roti spice blend. The potatoes break down slightly during cooking, creating a naturally thick, creamy sauce that clings to the green beans.

1. Heat the oil in a large pot. Sweat the onions until soft and translucent.
2. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant.
3. Stir in the roti spice and toast briefly to bloom the aromatics.
4. Add the canned tomatoes and cook for 2-3 minutes, breaking them up with a spoon.
5. Add the green beans and coat with the spice mixture.
6. Pour in the water or stock and season with salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer and cover.
7. Once the beans have softened a bit, add the potatoes and continue cooking, covered, until the potatoes are tender and breaking down and the beans are very soft.
8. Nestle the hard-boiled eggs into the curry and let them steep in the sauce to absorb the flavors.
9. Taste and adjust seasoning. The curry should be thick and saucy—add water if needed.

**To serve:** Warm the roti or paratha according to package directions. Place a generous portion of the curry on each flatbread, add an egg, and wrap. Alternatively, serve the curry and eggs on a plate with the flatbread on the side for tearing and dipping.

## Roti Spice (Masala)

Makes about 60 grams (enough for multiple batches)

- 2 tablespoons coriander seeds
- 1 tablespoon cumin seeds
- 1 tablespoon fennel seeds
- 1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds
- 1 teaspoon black mustard seeds
- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
- 4-5 dried red chilis (adjust for heat preference)
- 1 tablespoon turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger

This homemade roti masala is the heart of the dish. Toasting whole spices before grinding releases their essential oils, creating a more complex and aromatic blend than store-bought versions.

1. Toast the whole spices (coriander through dried chilis) in a dry skillet, stirring constantly, until fragrant and popping. Don't burn them.
2. Cool completely, then grind to a fine powder.
3. Mix in the turmeric and ginger.
4. Store in an airtight container—it keeps for months.

You'll know the spices are ready when your kitchen smells incredible and they've darkened slightly.

## Notes

- **Roti bread**: Store-bought roti or paratha works perfectly for weeknight cooking. Look for them in the frozen section of Asian or international grocery stores.
- **Make ahead**: The roti spice blend keeps for months. The curry itself reheats beautifully and often tastes even better the next day.
- **Variations**: Some versions add chickpeas, cauliflower, or other vegetables. The base technique remains the same.
- **Eggs**: Traditional recipes use hard-boiled eggs, but you can skip them for a vegan version or add tofu instead.
